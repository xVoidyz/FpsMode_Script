# FPS Boost Menu for FiveM – Performance optimization made easy
- This little helper can make a big difference, especially on crowded servers or on mid-performance PCs. Without having to make any major changes to gameplay, the FPS Boost menu ensures a better gaming experience – simple, fast, and effective.

# ⚙️ Features
🔒 Enable/Disable FPS Mode:
- Players can switch between optimized FPS mode and normal graphics at any time. This mode adjusts time cycle modifiers and environmental effects to simplify the graphics and improve performance.

# 🎯 Automatic client optimization:
- Every 60 seconds, the client is cleaned of unnecessary elements such as broken glass, help text, GPS flags, and blood effects – for consistently improved FPS values.

# 🎚️ Intuitive menu system:
- The FPS boost can be easily turned on or off via a clearly structured menu dialog. The menu navigation is deliberately kept simple so that every player can get used to it immediately.

# 🧠 Save state:
- The current state (active/inactive) can be saved on the server side, so settings are retained across multiple sessions (if supported on the server side).

# 🔗 Dependency
